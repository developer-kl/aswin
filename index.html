        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="para-profile">A big reason why we love video games so much, I feel, is because they are an escape from our sometimes boring and monotonous lives. Sometimes it’s nice to put on the shoes of a made-up character and forget about all our troubles. I know that after I’ve had a hard day, I come home and put on a headset and play a good game; Action-adventure games are my favorites because I get sucked into the game’s world and forget about everything around me.</p>

          <h3>FREEFIRE</h3>
          <p class="game-desc">Free Fire is a game for everyone. The title was specially made for low-end devices so that every Android user can experience the thrill of battle royale. Free Fire by Garena is one of the most played mobile games right now. A Battle Royale game by nature, Free Fire has been making waves since its initial release back in 2017. Although the game is immensely popular right now, Free Fire faces tough competition from PUBG Mobile and Fortnite for the top spot.</p>

          <h3>BOMBSQUAD</h3>
          <p class="game-desc">Bombsquad is a truely incredible game. Everything is physics-based. Somehow it adds an FPS element to a fighting game. There is a Freeze bomb to stop your opponents and/or shatter them with a punch, a Sticky bomb with a tendancy to cause disturbing ends, Smart bombs that detonate on impact, Mines that explode on contact, and Multi-bombs that cause you to spit out bombs at high speeds. The bombs have fuses and they tend to roll. The subtle power-ups and other things allow for ad-hoc fighting that wouldn't be out of place in Spelunky. It is easy to pick up, easy to teach, satisfying even if you are playing alone.</p>

          <h3>DREAM LEAGUE</h3>
          <p class="game-desc">Dream League Soccer is a fun soccer game with average to good graphics. The critical shortcoming it has is that stealing the ball is easy if you just guide the player to the ball, the ball mystically comes in your possession after pushing the other player down, ie if the player is strong enough or so. The same applies when you attack, just the inverse applies and the opponent player can steal the ball from you when he's in a chase or approaching straight from the opposite direction. Also, maintaining the virtual money you get is another great challenge as you can't move to the next division unless your stadium’s capacity is upgraded, so it's hard to balance between transfers and upgrades</p>
